Power cuts due to transmission lines, how frequent and how much energy wasted

üîß Key Components to Simulate
Variable	Description
datetime	Timestamp of the event (simulate over days/months)
region/state	Affected state or region
outage_duration_hrs	Duration of the power cut in hours
energy_lost_mwh	Estimated energy not delivered (MWh) during outage
cause	Cause of failure (transmission, weather, technical, human error, etc.)
severity	Derived or categorical impact (e.g., low, medium, high)
weather_condition	(Optional) Rain, storm, heatwave, etc. during event
peak_time	Whether it occurred during peak hours (yes/no)

üß≠ 1. Minimizing Energy Waste
üîç How?
Avoid overproduction (especially from fossil fuel sources)

Detect and fix inefficient consumption patterns

Manage load dynamically (e.g., shift non-critical demand off-peak)

‚úÖ What to Do:
Train demand forecasting models (LSTM, Prophet, XGBoost) using your hourly/monthly consumption data

Use these forecasts to schedule generation accurately

Deploy anomaly detection to flag unusually high or low consumption


‚öñÔ∏è 3. Balancing Generation, Storage, and Transmission
üîç How?
Match generation schedules with predicted demand

Store surplus (e.g., from solar during daytime)

Distribute load spatially across less-stressed regions

‚úÖ What to Do:
Train models to optimize dispatch: when to use solar, hydro, thermal, etc.

Forecast renewable generation based on solar irradiance / wind speed

Use reinforcement learning or LP optimization to balance supply and demand with storage



üü° 1. Groundwater
üîß Disruptions:
Drying borewells: Over-extraction causes wells to run dry.

Pump failures: Frequent due to deep drilling and power fluctuations.

Water contamination: Pollution from sewage, industrial waste, and landfills.

Illegal drilling: Leads to unregulated and unsustainable use.

üå¶Ô∏è Influencing Factors:
Recharge levels, which depend on rainfall and permeability of the soil.

Urbanization (reduces groundwater recharge due to concretization).

Depth of aquifers and geological conditions.

üßê How to Assess "What-If" Conditions in Water Systems
1. Define Failure Scenarios
Pipe bursts or leaks in critical zones.

Pump failures or power outages.

Sudden drought leading to groundwater depletion.

Contamination events causing supply shutdown.

Demand surges (e.g., heatwave or population spike).

2. Set Up Simulation Framework
Use your water consumption and groundwater models as baseline.

Introduce perturbations representing failures:

Reduce supply by X% or shut off certain pipes.

Limit pumping capacity.

Change demand patterns (e.g., water restrictions).

Model recovery mechanisms: repair time, backup supply activation.

3. Incorporate Feedback Loops
Groundwater levels dropping faster due to over-pumping.

Increased demand on alternate supply routes.

User behavior changes in response to restrictions.

4. Analyze Outputs
Water availability vs. demand over time.

Zones affected most severely.

Time to recovery.

Environmental impact (e.g., groundwater stress).



Input Type	Examples / Details
Historical Consumption Data	Water usage patterns by zone, time of day/week/month
Weather Forecasts	Rainfall, temperature forecasts to adjust irrigation needs
Population & Demographics	Number of residents, industrial activity, growth trends
Infrastructure Data	Network topology, pipe sizes, pump capacities, reservoir capacities
Groundwater Levels	For sustainable extraction constraints
Operational Constraints	Max pump capacity, reservoir refill rates, pressure limits
Cost Data	Energy cost for pumping, water tariffs
Policy Rules	Water restrictions, priority zones, emergency protocols

1. Minimize Unmet Demand (Blackouts)
Goal: Ensure the sum of available sources meets the demand, even during disruptions.

Approach:

Use Linear Programming (LP) or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to schedule generation or load shedding.

In case of grid_supply disruptions, shift reliance to solar (if available), storage (if added), or backup sources.

4. Demand Forecasting + Preemptive Scheduling
Use ML to:

Predict demand (based on datetime, temperature, past demand)

Forecast solar_generation (based on irradiance, temperature)

Use predictions in optimization to plan ahead for:

Grid allocation

Load curtailment

Battery storage (if added later)

5. Disruption-aware Resource Allocation
Use disruption_type and severity as signals to:

Preload storage or battery before a forecasted failure

Reroute supply from nearby grids (in simulation)

Shed non-critical load
